# Installation
First you need to install gulp,
npm install -g gulp
You need a local server for testing. Json-server is a good option because its very easy yo use
npm install -g json-server
In your working directory, find the root and run the next command
npm install

# Running the project
In the root directory run:
gulp serve

the project will run in localhost port:4242     http://localhost:4242/

This command starts all the application tasks needed for development 2. In the server directory run:

json-sever db.json
Now you have a server running and managing all your requests
